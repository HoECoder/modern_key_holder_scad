[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) Rebuild of [Modern Key Hanger](https://www.printables.com/model/151052-modern-key-hanger) by [XYZ Space](https://www.printables.com/@XYZSpace)

Built with defaults that produce a very close result with some additional bonus features to make it easy to make a repeating tesselation of hangers. The defaults are fully compatible with the individual hangers from the original.

Utilizes the stock [BOSL2](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2) library.

Only tested with recent releases of OpenSCAD that have `fast-csg` and `manifold` options.
